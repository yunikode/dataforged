    Description: |-
      The **session moves** fit into the flow of mechanics and fiction before, during, and after play. They provide methods for setting up content boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and ending your Starforged sessions. They are intended for solo, co-op, and guided modes.

      Unlike most other moves, these session moves function primarily from the perspective of the players instead of your characters. They are a tool to moderate and facilitate safe and enjoyable play.

          **When you begin a significant session or chapter of play**, do all of the following.

            * Identify or adjust flagged content and [Set a Flag](Starforged/Moves/Session/Set_a_Flag).
            * Review or recap what happened last session.
            * Set the scene by envisioning your character’s current situation and intent.

          In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.

            * **Refocus:** This is not the most important thing happening right now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
            * **Replace:** This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
            * **Redirect:** Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision how another person or party becomes involved.
            * **Reshape:** The situation changes completely. Envision what happened instead.

      In the fiction of the *Starforged* setting, those who swear vows are the Ironsworn, and their promises are binding.

          **When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing relationship (not an ally or companion)**, roll +heart.

          On a **strong hit**, you create a connection. Give them a role and rank. Whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated with their role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

          On a **weak hit**, as above, but this connection comes with a complication or cost. Envision what they reveal or demand.

          On a **miss**, you don't make a connection and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

    Description: |-
      The Forge is a perilous galaxy. Factions fight for control. Pirates hunt the spaceways. Raiders prey on vulnerable settlements. Dangerous creatures and chaotic terrors stalk the unwary. Dreaded foes and powerful forces will oppose your sworn quests. Eventually, you'll be forced to fight.

      When you face one or more foes in high-stakes, action-oriented conflict, use the **combat moves**. These moves encompass on-foot action and vehicle sorties—or both as part of the same challenge.

    # NB: strictly speaking, these aren't a formal category of moves, but given their status as optional rules, grouping them together is practical

    Description: |-
      A **scene challenge** is an optional structured approach for resolving an extended non-combat scene against a threat or other characters, particularly when a time limit or looming danger adds extra urgency.

      Examples of a scene challenge include disarming a timed explosive, hacking a system while evading digital countermeasures, participating in a formal debate before a council, or competing in a hoverbike race.

          **When you face an extended or complex challenge**, name your objective and choose a rank as appropriate to the situation.
