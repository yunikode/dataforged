    Description: |-
      The **command vehicle** is your interstellar STARSHIP. It is a default asset for your character, taken when you begin your campaign. If you are playing with others, this is a shared asset; each of you may use the STARSHIP's abilities while aboard the craft.

      The command vehicle has an integrity meter and starts at 5 integrity. When your STARSHIP takes a hit, make the [Withstand Damage](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Withstand_Damage) move to see what happens.

      **Modules** are linked to your STARSHIP and offer additional options and advantages when aboard that vehicle.

      These assets are earned and managed by a single character. They can be shared with allies, but only if it's practical for them to make use of it (not everyone may know how to use a RESEARCH LAB).

      When you [Withstand Damage](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Withstand_Damage) and score a miss, you can mark a module as broken to offset further danger for your STARSHIP. Flip the card over to indicate its broken state. A broken module cannot be used until you successfully [Repair](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Repair) it.

      **Support vehicles** complement your command vehicle for planetside or short-range operations. If you are playing with others, one of you might serve as the pilot or owner of a support vehicle, but anyone on board can use its abilities as appropriate to the situation.

      As with the command vehicle, your support vehicles have integrity meters. The maximum integrity varies based on the type of vehicle. When a support vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment, you must [Withstand Damage](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Withstand_Damage) to see how it fares.

      **Paths** are your background, interests, training, skills, powers, and key equipment. They provide mechanical and narrative advantages, but also reflect who you are and how you interact with the world. When you create your character in the next chapter, you'll select at least two paths to get started.

      Some paths represent your skill with a signature weapon style or piece of equipment. If you see a requirement at the top of the asset card, such as “If you wield a bladed weapon…,” the asset is only usable when taking action using that item.
