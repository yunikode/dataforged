Description: |-
  When you create a progress track, give the challenge a rank. In increasing order of severity, the ranks are **troublesome**, **dangerous**, **formidable**, **extreme**, and **epic**.

  Ranks help gauge the difficulty of a challenge. More importantly, they are a measure of its complexity. Higher ranked challenges will require more focus, more steps to complete, and more timeâ€”both in the imagined world and at the table. Troublesome is used for simple challenges. Dangerous is a typical challenge. Formidable is an intimidating challenge. Epic and extreme challenges require great effort and luck to overcome.

  Important NPCs can be given a rank to help gauge their relative scale, power, and abilities. If you are undertaking a quest to defeat an NPC, facing an NPC in a fight, or establishing an NPC as a connection, their rank is considered along with the other aspects of the situation and goal.

  When choosing a challenge rank, you should also consider how well your character is positioned. If circumstances give you an unusual advantage or disadvantage, nudge the rank up or down appropriately. For example, if you [Enter the Fray](Starforged/Moves/Combat/Enter_the_Fray) weaponless and facing armed foes, you would raise the rank of your objective to reflect that disparity. If you secure the aid of a local scout before you [Undertake an Expedition](Starforged/Moves/Exploration/Undertake_an_Expedition), you could lower the rank of the journey to represent their help.
