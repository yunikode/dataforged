  - Name: Out of Action
    Description: |-
      When your companionâ€™s health is at 0 and you score a miss on [Companion Takes a Hit](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Companion_Takes_a_Hit), they are out of action. You cannot leverage their support until they gain at least +1 health. Envision what this means in the fiction of your scene.

      To give aid to a companion, make an appropriate move. Unless the asset describes otherwise, this is typically [Heal](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Heal) for people and creatures, and [Repair](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Repair) for mechanical companions.
