# Scene Challenges

A **scene challenge** is an optional structured approach for resolving an extended non-combat scene against a threat or other characters, particularly when a time limit or looming danger adds extra urgency. Scene challenges use a **formidable progress track**, countered by a **tension clock** with four, six, or eight segments.

Make the [Begin the Scene](Starforged/Moves/Scene_Challenge/Begin_the_Scene) move to start the challenge. To act within the scene, use the alternative versions of [Face Danger](Starforged/Moves/Scene_Challenge/Face_Danger) and [Secure an Advantage](Starforged/Moves/Scene_Challenge/Secure_an_Advantage) shown here. When the clock or progress track is filled, or the narrative is guiding you to a conclusion, [Finish the Scene](Starforged/Moves/Scene_Challenge/Finish_the_Scene).
