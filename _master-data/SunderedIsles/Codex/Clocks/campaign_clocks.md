# Campaign Clocks

Use campaign clocks to resolve the actions of entities such as factions and major threats in the background of your campaign.

## Setting a Campaign Clock

Give the clock a name and decide the number of segments: four, six, eight, or ten.

## Advancing a Campaign Clock

When you [Begin a Session](Starforged/Moves/Session/Begin_a_Session), make a check against any active campaign clocks. If advancing a clock is a not in doubt, fill in the next segment. If circumstances or time conspire to push the clock forward more rapidly, fill two segments.

If there are factors that create uncertainty, [Ask the Oracle](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Ask_the_Oracle) using the yes/no table.

Odds           | The answer is yes if you rollâ€¦
---------------|-------------------------------
Small Chance   | 10 or less
Unlikely       | 25 or less
50/50          | 50 or less
Likely         | 75 or less
Almost Certain | 90 or less

Set the chance of the clock advancing to *likely* as the default, and adjust up or down if other factors (including your own aid or interference) have a strong influence. If it is more likely, make it *almost certain*. If it is less likely, make it *50/50*. In exceptional circumstances, you can make it as low as *unlikely*.

**If the answer is yes**, fill a clock segment. If you also roll a match on your oracle dice, envision how this situation or project gains dramatic support or inertia, and fill two segments instead of one.

**If the answer is no**, do not fill a segment. The situation or project has stalled or encountered resistance. If you also roll a match on your oracle dice, envision a turn of events that pits new factors or forces against the clock.

## Completing a Campaign Clock

Once the clock is filled, the event is triggered. Envision the impact on your character and the setting.

If events in your campaign bring a definitive end to a situation or project tracked by a clock before it is completed, remove it from play.
