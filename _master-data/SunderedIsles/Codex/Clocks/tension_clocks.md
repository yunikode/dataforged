# Tension Clocks

Use **tension clocks** to represent a looming threat or deadline in a scene, or an escalating danger that persists across scenes. Unlike campaign clocks, tension clocks do not advance independent of your actions. They are smaller-scope clocks that fill as you suffer setbacks or fail to act.

## Setting a Tension Clock

Name the clock and decide the number of segments. If the danger or deadline is imminent, make it four or six segments. If it represents a longer-term threat, make it eight or ten segments.

## Advancing a Tension Clock

When you [Pay the Price](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price) or encounter a complication in a situation where a tension clock is active, you can resolve the cost or concession by filling a segment on the clock. If it is a dramatic failure, such as a miss with a match, make it two segments.

## Completing a Tension Clock

Once the clock is filled, time is up. The threat or deadline triggers. This should result in harrowing problems for your character.
If you escape the looming threat or deadline, or it is no longer relevant, stop the clock and remove it from play.
