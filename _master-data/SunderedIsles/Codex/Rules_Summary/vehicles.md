# Vehicles

There are three categories of vehicles.

## Command Vehicle

Your **command vehicle** is your [STARSHIP](Starforged/Assets/Command_Vehicles/Starship) asset, earned at character creation. If you are playing with others, you and your allies share this asset.

The [STARSHIP](Starforged/Assets/Command_Vehicles/Starship) command vehicle has an integrity meter, and can suffer from battered or cursed impacts.

## Support Vehicles

**Support vehicles** are assets that represent special secondary vehicles. They can be carried and launched by your [STARSHIP](Starforged/Assets/Command_Vehicles/Starship).

They have an integrity meter, and can suffer from the battered impact.

## Incidental Vehicles

An **incidental vehicle** is one you temporarily acquire through the course of your story. Incidental vehicles have an integrity meter, but cannot be marked as battered. When you board an incidental vehicle, envision its nature and assign a max integrity as follows.

  * **Heavy** incidental vehicle: 4 integrity
  * **Medium** incidental vehicle: 3 integrity
  * **Light** incidental vehicle: 2 integrity
