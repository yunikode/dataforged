# Momentum

Your **momentum meter** ranges from -6 to +10 and represents your inertia, luck, and confidence. It is located on the left side of your character sheet. Move results and asset abilities may prompt you to increase or decrease momentum.

## Gaining Momentum

You can gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. If a move tells you to add momentum—phrased as “take +X momentum”—increase your momentum meter by that amount.

## Losing Momentum

When you suffer a cost that causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage, make the [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) move. Using this move, as appropriate to the severity of the situation, reduce your momentum by -1, -2, or -3.

Some moves or assets will prompt you to [Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) as part of an outcome for an action, and may specify an amount of momentum to suffer, phrased as “[Lose Momentum](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-X).”

## Burning Momentum

**Burning momentum** is a powerful option to deliver a decisive result or avoid dire failure. When you have positive momentum, after you make an action roll, you may replace your action score with your current momentum value to improve your result.

## Resetting Momentum

After you burn momentum, you must reset your momentum by immediately adjusting your **momentum meter** to your momentum reset value.

The default reset is +2. This value is reduced when you suffer from an impact

  * If you have one impact marked, your momentum reset is +1.
  * If you have more than one impact marked, your momentum reset is 0.
