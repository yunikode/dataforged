# Progress Moves

There are several key moves, called progress moves, which utilize **progress tracks** to resolve the outcome of challenges.

## Making a Progress Roll

You don’t make an action roll when making a progress move. Instead, tally the number of fully filled progress boxes (those with four ticks). This is your **progress score**. Then, roll only the challenge dice and compare your progress score to the value of the dice.

> Momentum is ignored on a progress move. You cannot burn momentum on a progress roll, and you do not suffer negative momentum.

As with an action roll, if your progress score beats the challenge dice, it’s a strong hit. If you beat one of the challenge dice, it’s a weak hit. If you fail to beat either die, it’s a miss. The progress move will tell you how to resolve the challenge based on the outcome of your roll.
