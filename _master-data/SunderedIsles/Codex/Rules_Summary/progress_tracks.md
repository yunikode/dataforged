# Progress Tracks

A **progress track** measures your headway against a goal or obstacle, including quests, expeditions, connections, and fights.

Progress tracks are drawn as a row of ten boxes that you fill in—or **mark**—as you advance toward your goal. When you create a progress track, give the challenge a **rank**. In increasing order of severity, the ranks are **troublesome**, **dangerous**, **formidable**, **extreme**, and **epic**.

## Marking Progress

When a move tells you to **mark progress**, fill in the appropriate number of ticks or progress boxes per the rank of your challenge.

If a move prompts you to mark progress, and you have an asset ability that also instructs you to mark progress for that action, you may mark progress again. In other words, “mark progress” stacks. Every instance of progress earned within the same action allows you to mark the appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the rank of the challenge.

## Shared Progress Tracks

When you and your allies are working together to resolve a challenge—a quest, expedition, connection, or fight—you share a progress track. This is called a **shared challenge**. When a move prompts someone to mark progress for that challenge, it is marked on your shared progress track.
