# Moves

**Moves** are self-contained systems to resolve an action, scene, or question. There are moves to cover most uncertain or risky situations you encounter in *Starforged*. Moves are centered on the players and your protagonists. Other characters do not make moves.

When you do something or encounter a situation within the scope of a move, refer to the move and follow its instructions. When a move’s name is referenced by another move, you’ll see it as underlined text.

If you have a question about a specific term used within a move, check the glossary on page 124.

> Moves are preceded and followed by the **fiction**—the imagined narrative of your game. Take the time to **envision** the situation which triggers the move and what changes as a result of the move.

## Group Moves

When you are adventuring with allies—protagonists portrayed by other players—one of you often make moves to resolve a challenge for the group. This represents that character taking the lead in a particular scene.

Unless a move specifically offers benefits for your allies, any mechanical bonus you gain from a move is applied only to the character making the move. Everyone else benefits from the narrative success.

When you make a move for your group and face a negative outcome, you should apply mechanical and narrative costs to an individual or the group in a way that best fits the current situation.
