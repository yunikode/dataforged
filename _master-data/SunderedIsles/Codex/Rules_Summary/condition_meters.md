# Condition Meters

Along the right side of your character sheet are three **condition meters**: **health**, **spirit**, and **supply**. Their values are reduced when you face hardship through a **suffer move**, and increased when you make **recover moves**.

  * **Health** represents your physical condition and stamina.
  * **Spirit** is your morale and mental state.
  * **Supply** is an abstract representation of your overall preparedness, including food, water, fuel, weapons, ammo, equipment, cargo, money, and general upkeep.

## Allies and Supply

If you are playing with allies, you share the same supply value. If any of you make a move to increase supply, or suffer the result of an outcome that forces you to [Sacrifice Resources](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Sacrifice_Resources), each of you adjust your supply meter accordingly.

## Asset Condition Meters

Some assets have their own condition meters, such as a vehicle’s **integrity meter** or a companion’s **health meter**. Track their status using the condition meter on the asset card.
