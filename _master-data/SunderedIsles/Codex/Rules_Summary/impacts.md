# Impacts

**Impacts** represent temporary, long-term, and permanent disadvantages. Moves will tell you when to mark an impact, or may give you an option to mark an impact to avoid a greater danger.

Impacts reduce your max momentum. Each marked impact reduces your max momentum (normally 10) by 1.

Impacts also reduce your momentum reset:

  * If you have one marked impact, your momentum reset is +1 (instead of +2).
  * If you have more than one marked impact, your momentum reset is 0 (instead of +2).

## Misfortunes

  * **Wounded** may be marked when you are at 0 health and fail to [Endure Harm](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Endure_Harm). You are severely injured.
  * **Shaken** may be marked when you are at 0 spirit and fail to [Endure Stress](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Endure_Stress). You are despairing or distraught.
  * **Unprepared** is marked when you [Sacrifice Resources](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Sacrifice_Resources) and are reduced to 0 supply. You are not properly equipped for the dangers of the Forge. Because you and your allies share the same supply value, you mark unprepared together.

> If you are wounded, shaken, or unprepared, you cannot increase the associated condition meter until you make a **recover move** to clear the impact.

## Vehicle Troubles

  * **Battered** may be marked when your vehicle is at 0 integrity and you fail to Withstand Damage. It’s barely holding together. Until you successfully Repair, you cannot raise the vehicle’s integrity.
  * **Cursed** may be marked when your command vehicle is at 0 integrity and you fail to Withstand Damage. This is a permanent impact. Your ship will never be quite right again.

> Vehicle troubles are only a factor when you are piloting or aboard that vehicle. Otherwise, they do not count as an impact and do not affect your maximum momentum and momentum reset.
>
> If playing with allies, a vehicle trouble affects anyone on the vehicle, regardless of who owns or manages the asset.

## Burdens

  * **Doomed** is marked when you Face Death and return from death’s door with a soul-bound quest.
  * **Tormented** is marked when you Face Desolation, gain visions of a distressing future, and undertake a quest to prevent that dire fate.
  * **Indebted** is marked when you Overcome Destruction. To replace what was lost and repay the debt, you will take on a duty-bound quest.

> Burdens leave you bound to new vows. Clearing a burden can only be accomplished by resolving the quest.

## Lasting Effects

  * **Permanently harmed** may be marked when you are at 0 health and fail to [Endure Harm](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Endure_Harm). You have suffered a wound that you must reckon with, such as the loss of an eye or hand. Or you bear physical scars that are a constant reminder of a harrowing incident.
  * **Traumatized** may be marked when you are at 0 spirit and fail to [Endure Stress](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Endure_Stress). Your experiences have left you emotionally or mentally scarred.

> Lasting effects are permanent. They forever impact your character through the momentum adjustment and—more importantly—the narrative impact.
