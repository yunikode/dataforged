# Oracles

Make the [Ask the Oracle](Starforged/Moves/Fate/Ask_the_Oracle) move to help guide your campaign. The most basic function of this move is to answer a yes/no question, but you can also use **oracle tables** (starting on page 26 of this guide) to generate story events, locations, characters, creatures, and more.

Whenever you are prompted to generate a result between 1 and 100, roll two ten-sided dice. Decide before rolling which represents the tens digit and which is the units. This is an **oracle roll**.
