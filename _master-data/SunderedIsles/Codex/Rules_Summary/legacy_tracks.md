# Legacy Tracks

As you complete **quests**, form **bonds**, and make **discoveries**, you advance along your **legacy tracks**.

## Marking Legacy Rewards

In recognition of notable achievements, moves and assets will prompt you to mark ticks or fill boxes on one or more legacy tracks.

Legacy tracks do not have a rank, but are otherwise treated the same as a standard progress track. It takes four ticks to fill a box.

> Fill the legacy track boxes completely from left to right. If you have a partially filled legacy track box and gain a legacy reward of one or more boxes, convert the reward to ticks. For example, 2 boxes is 8 ticks. Then, fill the incomplete box first.

## Gaining Experience

When you fill a legacy track box with four ticks, make the [Earn Experience](Starforged/Moves/Legacy/Earn_Experience) move. Per that move, take 2 experience for each newly filled legacy box.

The two **experience counters** attached to a full legacy track box each represent 1 earned experience that is ready to spend.

## Spending Experience

You spend earned experience to gain or upgrade assets. Per the [Advance](Starforged/Moves/Legacy/Advance) move, it costs 2 experience to upgrade an existing asset, and 3 experience to buy a new asset. Once you spend experience, fill in the experience counters.

## Rolling on a Legacy Track

If a move prompts you to make a test against a legacy track, treat it as a standard progress roll. Tally the number of filled boxes on the track for your progress score. As with a progress roll, momentum is ignored.

## Clearing a Legacy Track

When you fill all ten boxes on a legacy track, erase all boxes and experience counters, and resume marking legacy rewards in the now empty track.

When you clear the track, mark the +10 bubble in the top right corner. This is your reminder to treat the value of the track as +10 if you make a progress roll against it.

## Earning Experience on a Completed Track

Because a completed legacy track represents a character nearing the height of their potential, you gain experience at a slower rate on that track. Take 1 experience for each filled legacy track box instead of 2.
