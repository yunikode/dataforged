# Equipment

Your **supply meter** is an abstract representation of your overall readiness. You are otherwise armed, armored, and equipped as appropriate to your vision of your character.

Make note of equipment at whatever level of detail you like. Envision how it enables you to make moves where that gear is important, or perhaps allows you to avoid the risky nature of a move altogether.

If you ever need to know if you have a specific helpful item, make the [Check Your Gear](Starforged/Moves/Adventure/Check_Your_Gear) move.
