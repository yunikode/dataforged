# Assets

Assets represent your background, skills, traits, companions, and resources. They have abilities that give you additional options and bonuses when making a move—or sometimes act as their own self-contained moves.

> Unless an asset specifically defines a benefit for a progress move, you may not leverage an asset ability when making a progress roll.

When you create your character, you pick three assets. You also start your campaign with a [STARSHIP](Starforged/Assets/Command_Vehicle/Starship) command vehicle.

As you mark progress on your legacy tracks, you [Earn Experience](Starforged/Moves/Legacy/Earn_Experience). This experience is spent to purchase or upgrade assets through the [Advance](Starforged/Moves/Legacy/Advance) move.

## Buying an Asset

Buying a new asset costs 3 experience. All assets include three abilities. The first ability is enabled when you purchase the asset.

## Upgrading an Asset

It costs 2 experience to claim the second or third ability for an existing asset. When you spend experience to upgrade an asset, fill in the dot on the asset card to show you’ve acquired the ability. The second and third abilities may be selected in any order.
