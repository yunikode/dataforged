# The Action Roll

Roll your action die (d6) and two challenge dice (2d10).

Then, add a stat to your action die. The move will tell you what stat to add (phrased as “roll +stat”), or may give you a choice. Some moves will tell you to use a condition meters, such as health or supply, in place of a stat. You may also have an opportunity to apply one or more bonuses called adds (phrased as “add +X”).

The total of your action die, your stat, and any adds is your action score. Your action score is never greater than 10.

To determine the outcome of your move, check if the action score beats the individual values of the challenge dice.

## Action Roll Outcomes

There are three possible outcomes for the action roll.

**Strong Hit:** Your action score beats the value of both challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.

**Weak Hit:** Your action score beats only one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.

**Miss:** Your action score doesn’t beat either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions.

> Remember: Your action score needs to beat—not equal—the challenge dice to count as a hit. Ties go to the challenge dice. Since your action score can’t exceed 10, this means you never beat a 10 on a challenge die.
